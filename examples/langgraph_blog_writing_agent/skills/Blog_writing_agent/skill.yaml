name: LangGraph Structured Technical Blog Agent
version: 1.0.0

description: |
  A production-grade technical blog generation agent built with LangGraph
  and OpenAI (gpt-5.2).

  Architecture:
  - Orchestrator: Generates a strictly validated blog outline using a Pydantic schema (Plan + Task).
  - Worker Nodes: Independently generate detailed Markdown sections based on structured goals.
  - Reducer: Combines all generated sections into a cohesive final blog post.

  Core Capabilities:
  - Schema-enforced structured planning
  - 5–7 section automatic decomposition
  - Map-reduce parallel section writing
  - Developer-focused technical precision
  - Markdown-first clean formatting
  - Explicit inclusion of edge cases, trade-offs, and implementation details

  This agent ensures deterministic, high-quality, engineering-grade blog posts.
